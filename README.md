# Notes
Nowadays, should we learn servlets and jsp? Are they outdated? If you have questions like these,you can check the links below
- [Are servlets outdated?](https://www.quora.com/Are-servlets-outdated)
- [Is jsp still used?](https://www.quora.com/Is-JSP-used-JSP-is-almost-unused-nowadays-but-Spring-Boot-is-very-popular-nowadays-and-it-uses-JS-Is-JSP-popular-or-not)

In short, servlets are the solid foundation of web frameworks like spring, so they are never outdated. However, jsp is the oldest of the server-side rendered technologies, there are much better ones to replace.

Therefore, **you need to grasp the concepts about servlets , and just know the very basic usage of jsp** (for the completeness of this book) .
